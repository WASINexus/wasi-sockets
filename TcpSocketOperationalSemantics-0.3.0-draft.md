# Operational semantics of WASI TCP sockets

WASI TCP sockets must behave [as-if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As-if_rule) they are implemented using the state machine described in this document.

## States
> Note: These refer to the states of the TCP socket, not the [TCP connection](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9293#name-state-machine-overview)

In pseudo code:

```wit
interface tcp {
    variant state {
        unbound,
        bound,
        listening(accept-stream),
        connecting(connect-future),
        connected,
        closed,
    }
}
```

## Transitions
The following diagram describes the exhaustive set of all possible state transitions:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state "unbound" as Unbound
    state "bound" as Bound
    state "connecting" as Connecting
    state "connected" as Connected
    state "listening" as Listening
    state "closed" as Closed


    [*] --> Unbound: create-tcp-socket() -> ok
    Unbound --> Bound: bind() -> ok
    Unbound --> Connecting: connect()

    Connecting --> Connected: «task resolves successfully»
    Connecting --> Closed: «task resolves with error»

    Connected --> Closed: «connection terminated»

    Bound --> Connecting: connect()
    Bound --> Listening: listen() -> ok
    Unbound --> Listening: listen() -> ok
```

- Transitions annotated with `-> ok` only apply when the method returns successfully.
- Calling a method from the wrong state returns `error(invalid-state)` and does not affect the state of the socket.
- This diagram only includes the methods that impact the socket's state. For an overview of all methods and their required states, see [tcp.wit](./wit/tcp.wit)
- Client sockets returned by `accept()` are in immediately in the `connected` state.
- A socket resource can be dropped in any state.
